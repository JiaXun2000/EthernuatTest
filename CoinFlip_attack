CoinFlip is a interesting idea, randomly get CoinFlip using of the value of the previous block, and compare with the Guessing value.
Even though it looks like randomly, but actually it could be predicated, because it used last block value, so we can use this algorithm to compute blockhash quickly and 
set the Guessing value equal that. That is not very hard, because the block time setting 10s, and we only compute the value in a same block, 
so if we use the console maybe the time is not enough, 
so we could wright a smart contract.

Generating random numbers in solidity can be tricky. There currently isn't a native way to generate them, and everything you use in smart contracts is publicly visible, 
including the local variables and state variables marked as private. 
Miners also have control over things like blockhashes, timestamps, and whether to include certain transactions - which allows them to bias these values in their favor.
