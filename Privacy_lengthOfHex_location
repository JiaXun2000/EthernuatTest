This level is a pit, and if you ignorance, maybe you will trapped in it, because the Privacy Contract has a different number of varaiables than others on the web.
So the number of bits in the momery slots is different.For instance, the parameter in a command on the Internet is 3, but it is actually 5 during the test.

web3.eth.getStorageAt(instance,3,function(x,y){console.info(y);})
//this is a formal command on the web, but acctually like below:
web3.eth.getStorageAt(instance,5,function(x,y){console.info(y);})

contract.unlock("and the types here is bytes16 , so you should intercept the hex length")

Nothing in the ethereum blockchain is private. The keyword private is merely an artificial construct of the Solidity language. 
Web3's getStorageAt(...) can be used to read anything from storage. 
It can be tricky to read what you want though, since several optimization rules and techniques are used to compact the storage as much as possible.
