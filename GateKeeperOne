I create a contract which based on 0.8.0 version, but i can not solve gateThree, I guess that is because when i attempt to convert address type to bytes8 type in my code,
i may use wrong code like inline assembly, and others are fine.So i pass level by old version, of course, i will back to solve this problem with new version.

I solved this problem thoroughly with the help of a friend. 
The essence of this problem is not complicated, but there is a problem with type conversion. 
Due to the change of version, some types of conversion have slightly changed, so we need to pay attention to the change of version at all times.

For the same type, a small type can be converted to a large type, and a large type can also be converted to a small type.
But for different types, the conversion between formats can only be done with the same size, otherwise an error will be reported.

There is an interesting format conversion here. When the address type is converted to uint, the value obtained in the current version is the latter value. 
When the address type is converted to bytes type, the value obtained in the current version is the previous value.

I will upload my latest code to the corresponding file.
