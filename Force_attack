Force contract only have a contract, but no anything in it, we can use selfdestruct(address _Force) method to make the Force contract balance to 1.

First create a new Attack contract.We don't initiate the Force contract, we can use Inject Web3, deployed tow smart contracts seperately


contract.address  //get the instance address,which is the Force contract address

getbalance(Force address) //0

//after use attack contract 

getbalance(Force address) //1 wei,sucessful attack


In solidity, for a contract to be able to receive ether, the fallback function must be marked payable.
However, there is no way to stop an attacker from sending ether to a contract by self destroying. Hence, it is important not to count on the invariant address(this).balance == 0 for any contract logic.
